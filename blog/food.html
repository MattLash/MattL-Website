					        <p>
					        	So I came out to San Francisco to start building up my network
					        </p>
					        <br>
					        <p> 
					        	Back on the East Coast, a burger as described above is just about the minimum requirement.  A small, local diner chain called Jackson-Hole has a location situated in Englewood, New Jersey, which is where I found myself on this memorable day. Despite the recommendation I was given, I was quite skeptical of this supposed burger supremeness. 
					        </p>
					        <br>
					        <p>
					        	I ordered the burger standard as I do for the litmus test, like pizza, just cheese. Last second I decided to throw in the bacon, asked it to be cooked medium rare. I ended up the heavenly work-of-art you see above. The bacon was high-quality, likely maple-cured, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. As you can see they didn’t skimp on it either. The beef was certainly from a premium cut as it was dense with that juicy, beefy flavor one dreams of when they’re craving a burger. The beef was the perfect ratio of fat to lean, I’m guessing 80/20. As you can see, it was also huge. Must have been well over ½ pound. Definitely a top recommendation if you’re craving a burger. <a href="http://jacksonholeburgers.com/" target="_blank">Jackson Hole</a> also has several other locations in NYC.

						        <h5 class="text-muted">Wow.. </h5>
						        <p>	
						        	The best s'mores dish I've ever had. Period.
									It wasn’t overwhelmingly marshmallowy. Nor was it too soft. Consistency, flavors, warmth, it was all perfect. I really can’t describe it that well, you just need to try it.

						        	Georgio’s of Gramercy was loaded with several other phenomenal dishes. After eating several appetizers, 3 entrees between two of us, drinks, and two desserts, the bill still somehow came out to less than $100. Wow.

					        <h5 class="text-muted">This burger is heavenly</h5>
					        <p>
					        	I’m pretty particular about burgers. Especially since I lived in San Diego for so many years, and despite my love for that place, I will say with conviction that a real burger is almost non-existant there. In a society where In-n-Out burger is respected as the best burger around, the old-school style burger boasting an inch thickness or more, with a juicy, pink center is something people don’t even know about! It might be obvious that I’m more than jaded from many failed search expeditions for a good burger whilst living in So-Cal.
